Air Mouse Project

This project allows controlling the PC mouse using a smartphone’s motion sensors.
The mobile app sends motion data to Firebase, and a Python script reads it to move the cursor in real time.

Note:
Firebase service account key is not included for security reasons.
To run the project locally, generate your own key and place it next to receiver.py.

A demo video is included for reference.
