# Air Mouse Project

This project allows controlling a PC cursor using a smartphone's motion sensors.

## Tech Used
- Android (Kotlin)
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Python (PyAutoGUI)

## How it works
The Android app sends sensor data to Firebase.
The Python script reads the data and moves the mouse accordingly.

## Note
Firebase credentials are not included for security reasons.
